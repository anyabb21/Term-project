# Project Proposal: Smart Meal Planner App

## The Big Idea

For my project, I want to create a Python app that makes meal planning smarter. My main goal is to help users plan their meals based on their dietary preferences and nutritional needs.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP):
- Users can create profiles with their dietary preferences (like vegetarian or gluten-free).
- The app will generate a weekly meal plan tailored to each user.
- It will automatically create a grocery list based on the meal plan.
- I’ll start with a basic recipe database.

### Stretch Goals:
- Display nearest grocery stores with the preferred dietary foods and ingredients.
- Provide suggestions on how to improve overall diet.

## Learning Objectives

### Shared Goals:
- I want to get better at Python programming and front-end development.
- I want to learn how to apply this into developing a real app.

### Individual Goals:
- Everything. This is going to be a one man army.

## Implementation Plan

Here’s what I’m thinking for the tech stack:
- I’ll use Python as the main programming language.
- Flask will be the web framework.
- HTML will be used to develop the front-end (just like the MBTA app)

To kick things off, I’ll research existing meal planning apps and nutritional databases. Then, I’ll start building a simple algorithm for meal planning that I can improve over time.

## Project Schedule

Here’s a rough timeline for the project:
- **Week 1:** Set up the project, do some research, and design the basic architecture.
- **Week 2:** Develop the user profile system and a basic meal planning algorithm.
- **Week 3:** Implement the recipe database and grocery list features.
- **Week 4:** Create the user interface and integrate everything together.
- **Week 5:** Testing, fixing bugs, and if there’s time, start on the stretch goals.

## Risks and Limitations

One of the biggest risks is figuring out how to create an effective meal planning algorithm that takes into account different dietary restrictions and nutritional balance. I may need to simplify things at first and then refine them based on user feedback.

Another limitation could be finding accurate nutritional information for various recipes. I’ll need to be careful about that.


In summary, I’m excited about creating this smart meal planner app! Not only do I think it can help people eat healthier, but it also has the potential to reduce food waste. Plus, it’s a great opportunity for me to learn more about software development and data science along the way!
