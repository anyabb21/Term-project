# Project Proposal: Smart Meal Planner App

## The Big Idea

For my project, I want to create a Python app that makes meal planning smarter. My main goal is to help users plan their meals based on their dietary preferences and nutritional needs. This app helps save the user's time as well as making planning his nutrition and daily menu easier.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP):
- Users can create profiles with their dietary preferences (like vegetarian or gluten-free).
- The app will generate a weekly meal plan tailored to each user.
- It will automatically create a grocery list based on the meal plan.
- I’ll start with a basic recipe database.

### Stretch Goals:
- Display nearest grocery stores with the preferred dietary foods and ingredients.
- Provide suggestions on how to improve overall diet.

## Learning Objectives

### Shared Goals:
- I want to get better at Python programming and front-end development.
- I want to learn how to apply this into developing a real app.

### Individual Goals:
- Everything. This is going to be a one man army.

## Implementation Plan

Here’s what I’m thinking for the tech stack:
- I’ll use Python as the main programming language.
- Flask will be the web framework.
- HTML will be used to develop the front-end (just like the MBTA app)

To kick things off, I’ll research existing meal planning apps and nutritional databases. Then, I’ll start building a simple algorithm for meal planning that I can improve over time.

## Project Schedule

Here’s a rough timeline for the project:
- **Week 1:** Set up the project, do some research, and design the basic architecture.
- **Week 2:** Develop the user profile system and a basic meal planning algorithm.
- **Week 3:** Implement the recipe database and grocery list features.
- **Week 4:** Create the user interface and integrate everything together.
- **Week 5:** Testing, fixing bugs, and if there’s time, start on the stretch goals.

I am going to be a one man army

## Risks and Limitations

One of the biggest risks is figuring out how to create an effective meal planning algorithm that takes into account different dietary restrictions and nutritional balance. I may need to simplify things at first and then refine them based on user feedback.

Another limitation could be finding accurate nutritional information for various recipes. I’ll need to be careful about that.


In summary, I’m excited about creating this smart meal planner app! Not only do I think it can help people eat healthier, but it also has the potential to reduce food waste. Plus, it’s a great opportunity for me to learn more about software development and data science along the way!

Here's a refined and expanded version of your project evolution summary, incorporating the details we've discussed and emphasizing the key aspects of your development process:

### User Instructions/README

After opening the link, the user is welcomed by the opening page. He should then click on the Generate a Meal Plan button. He will be directed to another page where he inputs his desired calorie target and dietary preference. He is then directed to another page that displays breakfast, lunch and dinner as well as the recipes for each meal. He is also given the nutritional stats of all the meals together. There is also a random meal generator for in case he does not like the meals provided by the website. After that, he has the option to go back to the welcome page or generate another meal-plan.

## Project Evaluation

This project was successful as I was able to create a fully functioning meal plan generator that tailors appropriate breakfast, lunch, and dinner options based on the user's target calorie intake and dietary requirements.

### Phase 1: Initial Concept
In the initial phase, users were prompted to input their dietary preferences (such as Vegan, Gluten-Free, Keto, etc.) and their desired calorie target directly in the terminal. The program would then display three meal ideas corresponding to their inputs. These meal ideas were hard-coded under specific dietary preferences, allowing users to select from predefined options. The output was generated by a custom function, `meal_plans`, which utilized the `requests.get` method to fetch appropriate meal data based on user input.

### Phase 2: API Integration
In the second phase, I integrated the Spoonacular API to dynamically obtain meal parameters instead of relying on hard-coded values. This transition allowed for a broader range of meal options based on real-time data. However, the output was still displayed in the terminal using the same functions as before.

### Phase 3: Web Application Development
The third phase involved transitioning from a command-line interface to a web-based application using Flask. I developed a user-friendly interface where users could input their calorie targets and dietary preferences through a web form. Upon submission, they were redirected to another page displaying their selected meals along with nutritional statistics. This phase included creating three HTML pages: one for user input, one for displaying results, and one for error handling.

### Phase 4: Enhanced Functionality
In this phase, I added additional functionality to display detailed recipes for each meal using the Spoonacular recipe API. I also implemented a random meal suggestion feature, allowing users to discover new meal ideas spontaneously. This enhancement significantly improved user engagement by providing varied meal options.

### Phase 5: User Experience Improvements
To further enhance user experience, I created a welcome page (`welcome.html`) that introduces users to the application and guides them towards generating their meal plans. This page includes an inviting layout with an image and clear navigation links to start using the application.

### Challenges Faced
Throughout the development process, I encountered several challenges. The most significant issue arose when the site suddenly stopped functioning. With guidance from my professor, I discovered that my API key had been exposed in my public repository, leading to exceeding my daily request limit. This experience underscored the importance of securing sensitive information; I learned how to create a `.env` file to store API keys securely and prevent unauthorized access.

### Conclusion
Overall, this project has evolved from a simple command-line application into a robust web-based meal planning tool. It highlights not only my technical skills in programming and web development but also my ability to adapt and learn from challenges encountered along the way.
